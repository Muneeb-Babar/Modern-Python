# Modern Python

Modern Python refers to the current best practices, features, and enhancements in Python programming, particularly from Python 3.5 and onward. It focuses on making code more readable, efficient, and maintainable while leveraging new language features and libraries. Some of the key elements that define modern Python

## Installation

To install the project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can check your version with:

```bash
python --version
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Verify the installation by running the main script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Quick Start

To get started with the project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Run the basic example:**

   ```python
   import project_name

   # Run a basic function
   project_name.basic_function()
   ```

2. **Example Output:**
   ```bash
   "This is a basic output"
   ```

### Key Concepts and Functions

- `function_name(arg1, arg2)` – [Brief description of the function]
- `another_function()` – [Brief description of the function]

## Advanced Usage

For more complex use cases, you can use the project’s more advanced features.

### Example 1: Advanced Functionality

```python
from project_name.advanced_module import advanced_function

result = advanced_function(arg1='value', arg2='another_value')
print(result)
```

This function does [explain what the function does], and outputs [what it returns].

### Example 2: Customizing Behavior

You can also customize how the project works by modifying the configuration file or passing custom parameters:

```python
config = {
    'param1': 'value1',
    'param2': 'value2',
}

custom_result = project_name.custom_function(config)
print(custom_result)
```


## Testing

Testing is important for ensuring your code runs correctly. You can run the project’s tests with the following command:

1. **Run the unit tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Test coverage:**

   To check the test coverage, you can use:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=project_name tests/
   ```

### Test Example

Here's an example of a simple test:

```python
def test_basic_function():
    result = project_name.basic_function()
    assert result == "Expected result"
```
